--PROGRAM NAME: rlch3e9.cpp
--PROGRAM STATEMENT: Suppose you give a dinner party for six guests, but your 
table seats only four. In how many ways can four of the six guests arrange 
themselves at the table? Any of the six guests can sit in the first chair. Any of 
the remaining five can sit in the second chair. Any of the remaining four can sit 
in the third chair, and any of the remaining three can sit in the fourth chair. 
(The last two will have to stand.) So the number of possible arrangements of six 
guests in four chairs is 6*5*4*3, which is 360. Write a program that calculates 
the number of possible arrangements for any number of guests and any number of 
chairs. (Assume there will never be fewer guests than chairs.) Donâ€™t let this 
get too complicated. A simple  for loop should do it.
