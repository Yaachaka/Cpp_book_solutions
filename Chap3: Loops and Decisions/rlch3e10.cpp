--PROGRAM NAME: rlch3e10.cpp
--PROGRAM STATEMENT: Write another version of the program from Exercise 7 so that, 
instead of finding the final amount of your investment, you tell the program the 
final amount and it figures out how many years it will take, at a fixed rate of 
interest compounded yearly, to reach this amount. What sort of loop is appropriate 
for this problem? (Donâ€™t worry about fractional years; use an integer value for 
the year.)
