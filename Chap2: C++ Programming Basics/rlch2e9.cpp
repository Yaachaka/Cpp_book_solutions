/*
--PROGRAM NAME: rlch2e9.cpp
--PROGRAM STATEMENT: If you have two fractions, a/b and c/d, their sum can be 
obtained from the formula (a/b)+(c/d)=(a*d+b*c)/(b*d). For example, 1/4 plus 2/3 
is (1/4)+(2/3)=(1*3+4*2)/(4*3)=(3+8)/12=11/12. Write a program that encourages 
the user to enter two fractions, and then displays their sum in fractional form. 
(You donâ€™t need to reduce it to lowest terms.)  The interaction with the user 
might look like this: 
	Enter first fraction: 1/2 
	Enter second fraction: 2/5 
	Sum = 9/10 
You can take advantage of the fact that the extraction operator (>>) can be 
chained to read in more than one quantity at once: 
	cin >> a >> dummychar >> b;
